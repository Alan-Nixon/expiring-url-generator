***Welcome to Expiring URL Generator***

This package allows you to create expiring URLs and validate them.
## What does this package do?

## Input

To generate an expiring URL, you need to provide:
- The base URL

- Any additional parameters required for the URL

## Output

The output will be a URL that includes an expiration timestamp and a signature to validate the URL's authenticity.

## Intention
